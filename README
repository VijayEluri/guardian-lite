Guardian Lite.
An Android based article viewer for the Guardian newspaper.

Provides the latest articles for each Guardian section and allows navigation to articles for specific contributors and keywords.
Provides timed download functionality and on demand caching to the local file system.
The content retrieval protocol used is broadly compatible with the Guardian Content XML API.

Requirements
- Android 1.5 or better

Design goals:

Equally good online and offline experience:

- Viewing of content should not be dependent on a full download completing fully.
	This is an acknowledgment that alot of users will be using the app on an irregular basis.
   	Therefore we need to be able to fetch initial content as quickly as possible.

- Caching for offline use and fast page viewing
	 Content needs to be available when offline (ie. on the Tube).

Access to content

- Regular updates
	Play to the strength of the Guardian's content, in that it is constantly updated.
	Display news in descending date order and allow for it to be updated regularly.
	Provide a background process to apply refreshes.

- Make content discoverable.
	The Guardian offers thousands of keyword and contributer tags; too many to make discoverable through menus.
	Related keyword and contributor links on articles should allow users to discover this content.
	
Economic use of network resources

- Network traffic should be kept to the absolute minimum.
