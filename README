A basic Android based article viewer for the Guardian Content API.

Provides the latest articles for each Guardian section and allows
navigation to the latest articles for specific contributor and keyword tags.
Provides download all functionality and on demand caching to the local file system.

Requirements
- Android 1.5 or better
- Content API key (enter under the Settings menu option).


Design goals:

- Caching for offline use and fast page viewing
Content needs to be available when offline (ie. on the Tube).
Content needs to cached locally for quick navigation as online
browsing feels frustracting.

- Grab and go syncing.
The client needs to be able to grab as much content, as quickly as possible 
when prompted to. 

- Viewing of content should not be dependant on the download completing fully.
This is an acknowledgement that alot of users will be using the app 
on an irregular basis - it needs to be able to fetch content 
and get itself into a usable state ASAP.

- The user should be able to kill downloads at any point and still have 
access to what was actually downloaded.
- The app should be usable (all be it without a full content set)
while a download is in progress. Use Android background processes 
to achieve this.
- Downloads should fetch the bare minimum (ie. the article text) first and
then go back for images as time permits.


- Regular updates
Play to the strength of the Content API, in that it constantly updated.
Display news in descending date order and allow for it to be updated regularly.
Provide a background process to apply top ups.

- Make content discoverable.
The Guardian offers thousands of keyword and contributer tags;
too many to make discoverable through menus etc.

Therefore, display related keyword and contributor links on articles navigated to by top level section. 
Allow users to access this content on demand, if it is not locally cached and a network link is available.
Allow users to add these discovered tags to the list of content to sync.


TODO

- Progress display and start/stop controls for content update process.
- Hide invalid sections and articles with no distribution rights.
- UI formatting.
- Marking sections, keywords and contributors for syncing
