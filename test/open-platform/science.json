Maybe it's the early morning surprise attack I launched  \u2013 my four year old  let out of the backdoor as they yet again ate the bread for the birds. Maybe they're regrouping in the spotted laurel, planning their next sortie. Either way, I know, with the weariness of the besieged, that it won't be long before battle is rejoined.</p><p>\"They're very smart, they work things out, and chew their way into people's houses and suss out how to get exactly what they want,\" says Ian Woods of Grey Squirrel Control. There are estimated to be more than 2.5 million squirrels in England, Scotland and Wales. Last summer, with the warm weather encouraging us to leave our kitchen door open, the low-level dirty war that the squirrels had been waging on our house (gnawing a hole through the shed and ripping open the binbags buffet-style) stepped up a notch. I began to find them in the kitchen, rummaging through the bread bin.</p><p>Then they discovered the bathroom skylight and started coming in through that. Battle culminated with me and one particularly stubborn little fighter facing off on the stairs, trying to work out who was going to get out of the way first (me, of course).</p><p>So what can you do? Woods says that more and more people are buying traps from him. \"However, it's illegal to re-release squirrels into the wild. So if you use a live trap, you need to kill the squirrel yourself and the only legal ways of doing that are shooting it with an air rifle, or putting it in a sack and hitting it on the head.\"</p><p>In other words, they've got us, chaps.

        "body":"<p>It was a dream that began nearly 15 years ago, when Craig Venter, a Vietnam veteran turned geneticist, resolved one day to create a genome from scratch \u2013 and with it, make the first ever synthetic life form. Last night, in a dramatic announcement that led some to accuse him of playing God, Venter said the dream had come true, saying he had <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/science.1190719\">created an organism with manmade DNA</a>.</p><p>The feat, hailed as an epochal scientific breakthrough by some but an alarming development by others, was achieved by scientists at the J Craig Venter Insititute in Rockville, Maryland using little more than a computer, some common microbes, a DNA synthesizer and four bottles of chemicals.</p><p>The result \u2013 after $40m (£28m) and more than a decade \u2013 is the first microbe that thrives and replicates with only a synthetic genome to guide it. Every \"letter\" of its genetic code was made in the laboratory and stitched together, forming an artificial chromosome 1m characters long.</p><p>Despite the scale of the achievement, the organism in question could scarcely be more lowly \u2013 it is based on a bacterium that causes mastitis in goats.</p><p>While scientists and philosophers have already begun to debate the potential consequences and moral implications of the work, the motivating force for Venter is commercial. His team has an even more ambitious dream: to create organisms that are not only new, but also lucrative. Venter has secured a deal with the oil giant ExxonMobil to create algae that can absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and convert it into fuel \u2014 an innovation he believes could be worth more than a trillion dollars.</p><p>The new bacterium, Venter said, is \"the proof of the concept that we can make, in theory, changes across the entire genome of an organism, that we can add entirely new functions, eliminate those we don't want, and create a new range of industrial organisms that put all of their effort into doing what we want them to do. Until this experiment worked, the whole field was theoretical. Now it is real.\"</p><p>To create the organism, Venter's team began with a computer reconstruction of the genome of a common bacterium, Mycoplasma mycoides. The information was fed into a DNA synthesizer, which produced short strands of the bug's DNA. These strands were then stitched together by inserting them first into yeast and then into E coli bacteria. The bugs' natural repair mechanisms saw the strands as broken fragments and reassembled them.</p><p>After several rounds, the scientists had pieced together all 1m letters of the bacterium's genome. To mark the genome as synthetic, they spliced in fresh strands of DNA, each a biological \"watermark\" that would do nothing in the final organism except carry coded messages, including a line from James Joyce: \"To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life.\"</p><p>The crucial step came next. The scientists took the synthetic genome and transferred it into another kind of common bug. As this bug multiplied, some of its progeny ditched their own DNA and began using the synthetic genome. Then the transformation began.</p><p>\"It's pretty stunning when you just replace the DNA software in the cell. The cell instantly starts reading that new software, starts making a whole different set of proteins, and in a short while, all the characteristics of the first species disappear and a new species emerges,\" Venter said.</p><p>Venter calls the organism a \"synthetic cell\" because it survives thanks to a manmade genome, but apart from the watermarking woven into its DNA, it behaves like any other M. mycoides. Some scientists argue it is not a new kind of life, but others say that does not detract from the feat. \"This is a remarkable advance,\" said Paul Freemont, a synthetic biologist at Imperial College London. \"The applications of this enabling technology are enormous.\"</p><p>But the work drew immediate criticism from others who fear it could trigger an environmental disaster or hand a gift to terrorists bent of developing weaponised microbes. \"This is a step towards something much more controversial: creation of living beings with capacities and natures that could never have naturally evolved,\" said Julian Savulsescu, an ethicist at Oxford University. \"The potential is in the far future, but real and significant: dealing with pollution, new energy sources, new forms of communication. But the risks are also unparalleled. These could be used in the future to make the most powerful bioweapons imaginable.\"</p><p>Pat Mooney, of the ETC group, which opposes synthetic biology, said: \"This is a Pandora's box moment. Like the splitting of the atom or the cloning of Dolly, we will all have to deal with the fallout from this alarming experiment.\"</p><p>Venter agrees that stringent regulations are needed to ensure synthetic organisms do not escape and cause damage. \"It's clearly a dual-use technology and that requires immense responsibility for whoever's using it,\" he said. \"We are entering an exciting new era where we're limited mostly by our imaginations.\"</p><p>And if the microbe were, somehow, to escape the tight security of Venter's lab? \"It will not grow outside the lab unless it is deliberately injected or sprayed into a goat. And we don't work with goats.\"</p><img alt='' src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-apidev/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Synthetic+life+breakthrough+could+be+worth+over+a+trillion+dollars+Article+1402287&ch=Science&c2=&c4=Craig+Venter%2CGenetics+%28Science%29%2CScience%2CWorld+news%2CNews+%28Tone%29%2CIan+Sample%2CUS+news%2CBiochemistry+and+molecular+biology%2CMicrobiology%2CBiology%2CPhilosophy+%28News%29%2CEthics+%28News%29%2CArticle+%28Content+type%29&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Ian+Sample%2C+science+correspondent&c7=10-May-20&c8=1402287&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n            <a href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/science/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/science/oas.html/@Bottom\" alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\"></img>\n            </a>\n          </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: science/2010/may/20/craig-venter-synthetic-life-genome|2010-05-24T22:53:03+01:00|b4c6c286105e610e8cdc4f52b3698b2e2d28080a -->",
