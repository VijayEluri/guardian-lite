Will the Twitter version follow? Photo by <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/cyron/\">Cyron</a> on Flickr. <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en\">Some rights reserved</a></em></p><p>Twitter is culling would-be advertising platforms that try to jump on its popularity by tweeting advertising messages via particular users.</p><p>In a <a href=\"http://blog.twitter.com/2010/05/twitter-platform.html\">posting to its company blog today</a>, the company says (after a bit of shilly-shallying around on how important everyone has told it that clarity is; as though many companies get people saying \"What we'd really like is for your strategy to be a lot more confusing, with products that have no rhyme or reason\") that </p><blockquote><p>\"It is critical that the core experience of real-time introductions and information is protected for the user and with an eye toward long-term success for all advertisers, users and the Twitter ecosystem.\"</p></blockquote><p>Which means that... </p><blockquote><p>\"For this reason, aside from Promoted Tweets, we will not allow any third party to inject paid tweets into a timeline on any service that leverages the Twitter API. We are updating our Terms of Service to articulate clearly what we mean by this statement, and we encourage you to read the updated API Terms of Service to be released shortly.\"</p></blockquote><p>Nobody however can quite figure out yet which services there are which inject paid tweets <em>via the Twitter API</em>. Now, there are plenty which inject them into timelines of tweets - such as Magpie and Tweetup. What's not clear is whether that means they're doing it via the API.</p><p>It also means that apps which pay for themselves by including adverts which clearly aren't tweets (such as Iconfactory's Twitterrific) aren't affected; those aren't injected via the API, and they're not appearing as tweets.</p><p>So could it be Magpie? <a href=\"http://be-a-magpie.com/en/\">Magpie</a> portrays itself as a simple way to get your ad out there on Twitter: </p><blockquote><p>\"Advertising on Twitter with Magpie is easy. Within a few steps you can have your campaign up and running. Once you have identified the opportunity simply propose a message, identify the conversation you want to join, decide how much you want to spend and then fund your campaign. We then select relevant twitterers and invite them to participate.\"</p></blockquote><p>The question is whether sponsored tweets like that will have the boom lowered. Quite how Twitter is going to identify them is going to be interesting to watch, but it's clear that the company has now decided that it should be the one controlling where the ad revenues flow, and that if people want to advertise in actual tweets, they will have to go through them <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/apr/13/twitter-advertising-google\">using its \"Promoted Tweets\" feature</a>.</p><p>The analyst Michael Gartenberg says that <a href=\"http://www.tweetup.com/\">Tweetup</a> will also be a casualty; it lets advertisers buy search keywords. As <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/1616728/twitter-ad-promoted-posts-advertising-twidroid-client-mobile-tweetup-seesmic-echofon\">Fast Company explained</a> when Promoted Tweets appeared, </p><blockquote><p>\"The advertising enters the picture when a lesser-known but still credible source wants to secure more followers. That could be a small company trying to spread word of mouth, a young writer or critic, or simply someone like me who feels his insights on The West Wing are as good (better than, really) any \"expert\" out there. That person pays a small fee, based on number of views, and will get a bump into the expert search results. Not necessarily stuck at the top, either; the money buys increased visibility, it doesn't buy intrusion.\"</p></blockquote><p>But now it looks like Twitter isn't going to allow anyone to do that. Again, the question is quite how it will filter out those added tweets - how it will distinguish from a group of people deciding it's #nickcleggsfault spontaneously and a group deciding that product X is <em>super tasty!</em> without human intervention (because humans don't scale, and Twitter must to make money). </p><p>Perhaps those will be revealed with the new terms of service. Between Facebook promising to update its privacy/publicity settings, and Twitter locking out the advertising platforms, it's an interesting time for the big names.</p><img alt='' src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-apidev/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Twitter+says+it+will+block+%27paid+tweets%27+pushed+into+timelines+via+API+Article+1403448&ch=Technology&c2=&c4=Twitter+%28Technology%29%2CTechnology+blog%2CCharles+Arthur%2CTechnology%2CPDA+blog%2CMedia%2CArticle+%28Content+type%29&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Charles+Arthur&c7=10-May-24&c8=1403448&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n            <a href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/technology/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/technology/oas.html/@Bottom\" alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\"></img>\n            </a>\n          </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: technology/blog/2010/may/24/twitter-to-block-paid-tweets-api|2010-05-24T22:56:07+01:00|7e4b91afee78a1632a6af4b39e2fcd8b6bf290f3 -->",

        "body":"<p>Facebook is to revise its privacy settings within weeks to make it simpler for people to keep their information private, according to Mark Zuckerberg, its founder and chief executive of the giant social network.</p><p>Acknowledging a growing level of irritation among the site's 450m users, Zuckerberg said: \"Simply put, many of you thought our controls [for determining who could see information about you] were too complex. Our intention was to give you lots of granular controls; but that may not have been what many of you wanted. We just missed the mark.\"</p><p>But Zuckerberg insisted that concerns that Facebook is selling personal data to advertisers were misplaced. \"We do not give advertisers access to your personal information,\" he said. \"We do not and never will sell any of your information to anyone.\"</p><p>Writing <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/23/AR2010052303828.html\" title=\"in the Washington Post\">in the Washington Post</a>, the 26-year-old insisted that Facebook will \"keep listening\" to users' concerns.</p><p>However, he stopped short of offering users the choice of opting in to having all their information spread throughout the social network and the internet \u2013 which may mean that the new settings will not satisfy users after all.</p><p>Facebook makes money principally by selling advertising space on users' pages; the adverts can be tailored to the interests or experiences of the users without the advertiser knowing who it is being sent to. Thus someone who says their favourite band is U2 might see adverts for a new album or concert tour by the band, though the advertiser will not have known precisely who was targeted.</p><p>A rising number of people have expressed dissatisfaction with the social network's ever-changing privacy policy, which has grown in complexity since the site began in 2004 \u2013 and has also seen the default settings for sharing information go from \"friends only\" to \"the entire internet\" for almost everything that people put on it.</p><p>The ease with which people can find out anything about people who are unaware of the settings has been demonstrated by a site which uses Facebook's new connectivity to its underlying database, launched on 21 April.</p><p><a href=\"http://youropenbook.org\" title=\"Youropenbook\">Youropenbook</a>, which has the tagline \"Facebook helps you connect and share with the people in your life. Whether you want to or not\", says that it wants Facebook to restore the privacy of information \"so that this website and others like it no longer work\".</p><p>The site's creators say there are two fundamental problems with Facebook now: \"First, they do not do a good job of indicating how public each piece of information you share on the site will be. Second, <a href=\"http://mattmckeon.com/facebook-privacy/\" title=\"they change the rules far too often\">they change the rules far too often</a>. If you understood Facebook's privacy settings two years ago (or even six months ago), that information would be worse than useless with today's bewildering settings.\"</p><p>Others think it is time to give up Facebook: one group has come up with a \"Quit Facebook Day\" idea, urging people to delete their accounts on 31 May.</p><p>Zuckerberg insists in the Washington Post article that Facebook will always be a free service \u2013 which suggests that it will have to continue to rely on selling advertising space targeted at users' interests and activities. That, in turn, means that at least some of the user information must be shared with advertisers, even in anonymised form. And that, in turn, must mean a limit on some of the limits that users can put on sharing their data.</p><p>He does not retreat in the article from his frequently-expressed view that sharing information is beneficial. \"Six years ago, we built Facebook around a few simple ideas,\" he writes. \"People want to share and stay connected with their friends and the people around them. If we give people control over what they share, they will want to share more. If people share more, the world will become more open and connected. And a world that's more open and connected is a better world. These are still our core principles today.\"</p><p>No date has been put on the release of the new privacy settings.</p><p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/may/19/facebook-privacy-settings-control\" title=\"How to control your Facebook privacy settings\">How to control your Facebook privacy settings</a> \u2013 from sharing everything to locking down your photos to deleting your account.</p><img alt='' src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-apidev/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Facebook+to+tweak+privacy+settings%2C+says+Zuckerberg+Article+1403291&ch=Technology&c2=&c4=Facebook%2CTechnology%2CMark+Zuckerberg+%28Technology%29%2CCharles+Arthur%2CInternet%2CPrivacy+and+the+net%2CSocial+networking%2CMedia%2CDigital+media%2CArticle+%28Content+type%29&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Charles+Arthur%2C+technology+editor&c7=10-May-24&c8=1403291&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n            <a href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/technology/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/technology/oas.html/@Bottom\" alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\"></img>\n            </a>\n          </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: technology/2010/may/24/facebook-revise-privacy-zuckerberg|2010-05-24T22:56:07+01:00|ccbaac0de13fe14a7b35586d93066343f2b80643 -->",

        "body":"<p>The Treasury's decision to close the education ICT agency <a href=\"http://www.becta.org.uk/\" title=\"Becta\">Becta</a> by November, cutting £80m from this financial year's government budget, has dismayed its 240 staff \u2013 and some teachers who found its work especially useful because it provided a central platform for standardising on technology.</p><p>The move has been made as part of the government's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2010/may/24/coalition-government-public-finance\" title=\"wider programme of cuts worth £6.2bn\">wider programme of cuts worth £6.2bn</a> for 2010-11.</p><p>\"Naturally we are very disappointed at the government's decision,\" said Becta's chairman, Graham Badman, and chief executive, Stephen Crowne. \"Becta is a very effective organisation with an international reputation, delivering valuable services to schools, colleges and children.</p><p>\"Our procurement arrangements save the schools and colleges many times more than Becta costs to run. Our Home Access programme will give laptops and broadband to over 200,000 of the poorest children. Our top priorities now are to make sure we have an orderly and fair process for staff, and that as far as possible schools, colleges and children continue to benefit from the savings and support that Becta has provided.\"</p><p>The organisation employs 240 staff and 120 contractors. On its site, Becta says that £1.5bn has been spent through its procurement agreements since 2002, and that this has saved the education system £223m \u2013 which would be an average of about £28m per year. It also says it has achieved cost savings of £55m for educational institutions and providers including schools, local authorities and the skills sector in the past year alone.</p><p>Early reactions were that Becta has been useful, and that closing it will lead to losses in expertise which will have to be made up by extra spending elsewhere. Paul Wareing, now an iPhone developer but for eight years a Becta employee, mourned its passing. He cited achievements such as the creation of the National Grid for Learning, launched in 1998, which provided a gateway to online educational resources; the Self-Review Framework, which let schools assess their own use of ICT; and Laptops for Teachers, which got teachers who might have been unfamiliar with computers to use them.</p><p>\"It was the envy of the world,\" <a href=\"http://twitter.com/paulwareing/status/14608089964\" title=\"Wareing wrote on Twitter\">Wareing wrote on Twitter</a>. \"The cost of its loss will be much more than the saving of its cost.\" He pointed to its initiatives such as work-based learning, offender learning, adult and community lending as well as schools and home access which will be ended \u2013 or shifted to other, less prepared agencies.</p><p>Fred Garnett, another Becta supporter, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/fredgarnett/status/14613133380\" title=\"commented\">commented</a>: \"[The] Becta closure won't save £62m &amp; must hit Home Access &amp; inclusion initiatives. The use of inaccurate term quango indicates sleazy politics.\"</p><p>Becta was also seen as having played an important role in driving down the cost of computers to schools. In 2005 it produced a paper suggesting that schools could halve their IT bills by adopting open source software rather than Microsoft's Windows and other applications. In 2008, it suggested that schools should adopt more open source software \u2013 which led to Microsoft dropping some of its costs for licensing software to schools.</p><p>Other teachers contacted the Guardian to cite Becta's ICT Baseline, which let teachers rate their ICT provision, as an example of good practice put in place by Becta.</p><p>The question now is whether the closure will indeed reduce overall costs of public sector spending.</p><p>Becta, formerly known as the British Educational and Communications Technology Association, was set up in 1988 to promote the effective use of ICT in education.

        "body":"<p>Back at the dawn of microblogging time, when Twitter had only just started, there were only three users who mattered: Biz Stone, Evan Williams and Jack Dorsey - the three key people behind the service. Now there are more than a hundred million users - but the key influencers in this huge network can be quite easily identified.</p><p>Now the team at Information Architects have decided to come up with <a href=\"http://informationarchitects.jp/c140/\">a neat Twitter visualisation</a>, akin to <a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/learning/histcitizen/fpage/science/science.html\">The Independent's classic 1992 \"How the universe began\" graphic</a>, of the top 140 Twitter influencers, \"sorted by #name #handle #category #influence #activity\" and by when they joined the service (which determines how close to the centre they are).</p><p>The size of the blob indicates how many followers; \"influence\" is measured by... actually, they don't explain, though possibly it's using something like the <a href=\"http://twinfluence.com/about.php\">Twiinfluence algorithm</a>.</p><p>Interesting to see who's in there: Stone and Williams, of course, but also latecomer <a href=\"http://twitter.com/marissamayer\">Marissa Mayer</a> (VP of search product and user experience at Google), who only joined in July 2009, and <a href=\"http://twitter.com/ericschmidt\">Eric Schmidt</a>, CEO of Google (December 2009) - and of course there's always <a href=\"http://twitter.com/billgates\">Bill Gates</a>, who didn't get on board until January 2010. And of course <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/stephenfry\">Stephen Fry</a> and indeed <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/wossy\">Jonathan Ross</a>.</p><p>You can get the <a href=\"http://informationarchitects.jp/c140_0_9.pdf\">PDF (1.1MB)</a> or buy it from them for $99 because, as they remark, \"we're convinced that our print is way superior to what you can do with your plotter\". And you will need a plotter - the graphic is 84cm by 119cm.</p><p>We're happy to see that @guardiantech is in there, showing up in something like the place <a href=\"http://www.sslmit.unibo.it/zat/images/cartography/Milky-Way_map_500pc_grid.gif\">where Kappa Velorum would be in the Milky Way</a>. (We've highlighted it below to help.)</p><p>Does this make any difference? Well.. it might do, if this list of the top 140 were made into a list. Anybody up for that, we wonder?</p><img alt='' src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-apidev/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=The+big+bang+visualisation+of+the+top+140+Twitter+influencers+Article+1403193&ch=Technology&c2=&c4=Twitter+%28Technology%29%2CTechnology+blog%2CTechnology%2CBlogpost+%28Tone%29%2CCharles+Arthur%2CPDA+blog%2CSocial+networking%2CDigital+media%2CMedia%2CArticle+%28Content+type%29&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Charles+Arthur&c7=10-May-24&c8=1403193&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n            <a href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/technology/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/technology/oas.html/@Bottom\" alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\"></img>\n            </a>\n          </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: technology/blog/2010/may/24/twitter-influencers-visualisation|2010-05-24T22:56:07+01:00|683fe58df96f073fd681292b906075f7044d60a7 -->",

        "body":"<p><br />Google's $750m acquisition of the advertising network company AdMod has been approved by the US Federal Trade Commission - because Apple's entry into the mobile advertising market with its iAds product suggests there is already enough competition.</p><p>After six months' deliberation, following Google's announcement of its intent to buy the company in November, the <a href=\"http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2010/05/ggladmob.shtm\">FTC said today</a> that the acquisition \"is unlikely to harm competition in the emerging market for mobile advertising networks.\"</p><p>The FTC said that although the combination of the two leading mobile advertising networks - Google and AdMob - raised serious antitrust issues, those were overshadowed by recent developments in the market, most notably a move by \"Apple Computer\" (as it called it - although the company has been \"Apple Inc\" for more than a year) to launch its own, competing mobile ad network. </p><p>Google's not the only one; a number of companies are trying to develop smartphone platforms to compete for advertising services with Google's Android and Apple's iPhone. \"These firms would have a strong incentive to facilitate competition among mobile advertising networks,\" the FTC noted.</p><p>Apple is thought to have wanted to buy AdMob itself - but Google trumped it with a rapid bid. That drove Apple instead to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/jan/10/google-nexus-one-apple-iphone\">buy Quattro Wireless for a reported $275m</a>. Quattro and AdMob both offered the same sort of functionality: a means of serving mobile advertising.</p><p>Apple has rolled Quattro's offering into its iAds product, which will be part of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/gamesblog/2010/apr/09/apple-iphone-game-center\">iPhone 4.0 upgrade due this summer</a>.</p><p>Eric Schmidt of Google had expected that Apple's acquisition would ease Google's path with the FTC - and was proved right. \"As a result of Apple's entry (into the market), AdMob's success to date on the iPhone platform is unlikely to be an accurate predictor of AdMob's competitive significance going forward, whether AdMob is owned by Google or not,\" the Commission's statement explains.</p><p>The FTC notes that Google and AdMob have competed head-to-head for the past few years, with a notable increase in intensity during the past year. \"This competition has spurred innovation and allowed mobile publishers to keep a large share of the revenue generated from the sale of their ad space. The companies also have economies of scale that give them a major advantage over smaller rivals in the business.\"</p><p>\"These concerns, however, were outweighed by recent evidence that Apple is poised to become a strong competitor in the mobile advertising market, the FTC's statement says. Apple recently acquired Quattro Wireless and used it to launch its own iAd service. In addition, Apple can leverage its close relationships with application developers and users, its access to a large amount of proprietary user data, and its ownership of iPhone software development tools and control over the iPhone developers' license agreement.\"</p><p>That's two companies in the mobile advertising space - so now what will Microsoft, which must need to get some skin in the game, do? And how about Nokia, which sells more smartphones than anyone else, yet doesn't seem to have worked out how to profit enough from them?</p><img alt='' src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-apidev/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Google%27s+%24750m+purchase+of+AdMob+approved+-+because+of+Apple+Article+1402748&ch=Technology&c2=&c4=Google+%28Technology%29%2CApple+%28Technology%29%2CTechnology+blog%2CTechnology%2CCharles+Arthur%2CAdvertising+%28media%29%2CMedia%2CArticle+%28Content+type%29&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Charles+Arthur&c7=10-May-21&c8=1402748&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n            <a href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/technology/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/technology/oas.html/@Bottom\" alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\"></img>\n            </a>\n          </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: technology/blog/2010/may/21/google-admod-acquisition-approved-apple|2010-05-24T22:56:07+01:00|c6212caa3cf24de6206fb56a2fc76317966af784 -->",

        "body":"<p></p><p>The company most people use to search the internet wants to be the company that delivers your TV programmes \u2013 and sells the adverts to run alongside them. That's Google, which has announced the launch of <a href=\"http://www.google.com/tv\" title=\"\">Google TV,</a> hoping to marry the technology of  television with the internet.</p><p>It wants to turn your TV set \u2013 or the set-top box above it \u2013 into a computer capable of turning web video into a TV signal so that you can range across the internet.</p><p>\"We've been waiting a long, long time for this day,\" Eric Schmidt, the chief executive of Google, told the Google I/O conference in San Francisco, where the company was showing off its latest technology offerings. \"It took a lot to make this happen.\"</p><p>In particular, it needed \"extraordinarily fast\" computer processors that had just become available, he said. But he admitted: \"It's much harder to link up a 50-year-old technology and a brand new technology than those of us from the brand new technology thought.\"</p><p>There are plenty of examples of companies trying to marry the internet to TV but ending with them as divorced as ever. Microsoft has tried twice, with WebTV and its mildly successful Media Center. Apple has AppleTV, a set-top box that even Steve Jobs dismisses as \"a hobby\". Then there's Joost (which discontinued its application last year), Yahoo Connected Life, Digeo and Intel's Viiv. None has penetrated the public consciousness.</p><p>Google insists it can work: \"Imagine turning on the TV and getting all the channels and shows you normally watch and all of the websites you browse all day \u2013 including your favourite video, music and photo sites,\" it says in a Googleblog <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/05/announcing-google-tv-tv-meets-web-web.html\" title=\"\">post</a>. \"We're excited to announce that we've done just that \u2026 Want to check out that funny YouTube video on your 48-inch screen? It's just a quick search away.\"</p><p>Despite appearances from Sony and Logitech, the first products are not expected until later this year \u2013 and some analysts think Google may be aiming for one of the net's \"zero-billion dollar markets\".</p><p>\"The road to interactive TV is littered with failures, mainly because people never get the user experience right,\" said Alx Klive, chief executive of WorldTV.com, who has been in the field of \"internet television\" since 1995. \"Too many companies don't understand the difference between sitting in front of a laptop, and sitting 10ft away from a TV. It's very hard to change people's habits: we've been watching TV in pretty much the same way for 60 years.\"</p><p>All that has changed, he suggests, is the addition of remote controls and, more recently, hard drive devices such as Sky+ and TiVo, which store the programme as a digital file so you can pause and rewind programs.</p><p>The key problem, said Klive, was finding enough content on the web to fill an evening. \"What we've found is that on average if people can't find something that's at least 40 minutes long online, they won't bother,\" he said.</p><p>But James Governor, of RedMonk Consulting in Maine, said Google was on to a winner. \"We are going to get integrated internet TV. I think that the integration of data-driven sports experiences will drive this in the US \u2013 where statistics matter so much for baseball, rather like statistics do for cricket here.\"</p><p>But there's another worry: if your TV becomes a computer, what happens when it crashes, its software is corrupted during an update, or it is attacked by malware? Though the latter risk remains unknown until the products are available, Kline said the second problem had already affected a Blu-ray DVD player bought in the US.</p><p>Governorsaid crashing was not a problem. \"Anyone who's got a Virgin Media or Sky box knows what it's like to have to unplug them and restart them. It's really not a big deal.\"</p><img alt='' src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-apidev/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Now+for+Google%27s+next+trick+%E2%80%A6+taking+over+your+television+viewing+Article+1402686&ch=Technology&c2=&c4=Google+%28Technology%29%2CTelevision+%28Technology%29%2CInternet%2CTechnology+sector+%28business+sector%29%2CTechnology%2CTelevision+and+radio+TV%2CTelevision+industry+%28Media%29%2CMedia%2CUK+news%2CWorld+news%2CCharles+Arthur%2CNews+%28Tone%29%2CArticle+%28Content+type%29&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Charles+Arthur%2C+technology+editor&c7=10-May-21&c8=1402686&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n            <a href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/technology/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/technology/oas.html/@Bottom\" alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\"></img>\n            </a>\n          </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: technology/2010/may/21/google-tv|2010-05-24T22:56:07+01:00|8ccdaf2bf4df1019d61d6e22bbbfda088be38f69 -->",

German data protection officials have given the company until 26 May to hand over the system.</p><p>Google admitted last week that it collected 600GB of data from unsecured Wi-Fi networks around the world while collecting photos to Street View</p><p>The UK Information Commissioner Christopher Graham <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/may/20/information-commissioner-war-google\" title=\"\">said on Thursday</a> that the ICO did not want to \"declare war\" on Google over the matter and that it thought its response \u2013 which was initially to accede to Google's offer to delete the data \u2013 was \"proportionate\".</p><p>However, Google now appears to have decided to delay the deletion while it makes sure that no investigations have been opened; otherwise it might be deemed to have destroyed evidence.</p><p>Privacy International <a href=\"http://www.privacyinternational.org/article.shtml?cmd[347]=x-347-566323\" title=\"\">says</a> that deleting the data would be \"irresponsible\" until its content has been investigated to see whether it does infringe the law. \"We have directly put Google on notice that it is likely to be imminently subject to civil or criminal legal action as a result of the Wi-Fi interception,\" it wrote on its blog. \"To eliminate the data would constitute destruction of evidence.\" It urged the ICO to rescind its earlier order to destroy the data: \"We urge the commissioner to immediately rescind the order and allow Google to place the data in secure storage until such time as the legal questions are resolved.</p><p>\"In the absence of a commitment from both Google and the commissioners to temporarily secure the data, Privacy International will seek a prosecution for unlawful interception under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act. In those circumstances there would be no question of destroying the data.\"<br /><em><br />Updated with statement from UK ICO that it is not seeking retention of data.</em><br /><em>Update with clarification that it is German data protection authorities, not prosecutors, who are seeking access to hard drive.</em></p><img alt='' src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-apidev/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Google+keeps+Street+View%27s+UK+Wi-Fi+data+as+privacy+group+seeks+legal+action+Article+1402595&ch=Technology&c2=&c4=Google+%28Technology%29%2CGoogle+Street+View+%28Technology%29%2CData+protection+%28Govt.%2Findustrial+use+of+data%29%2CPrivacy+and+the+net%2CTechnology%2CPrivacy%2CCharles+Arthur%2CUK+news%2CNews+%28Tone%29%2CzPrivacy+%28News%29%2CArticle+%28Content+type%29&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Charles+Arthur%2C+technology+editor&c7=10-May-21&c8=1402595&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n            <a href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/technology/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/technology/oas.html/@Bottom\" alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\"></img>\n            </a>\n          </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: technology/2010/may/21/google-street-view-uk-data|2010-05-24T22:56:07+01:00|244e3b315f93c13541332a575915d2df00de1fbe -->",

        "headline":"Google's VP8 gets thumbs down from Apple's Jobs via email",
        "body":"<p>Google's announcement that it is making the VP8 video codec available for free as an open source product has not won the approval of Steve Jobs - who has pointed to a blog post by an H.264 developer which says that the codec is \"significantly weaker\" for compression and decoding than H.264, which Apple backs and uses for HTML5 video.</p><p>In an email apparently sent at 4.30am California time to <a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/05/20/jobs_on_vp8/\">a reader of The Register technology news site</a>, Jobs simply points to the post at <a href=\"http://x264dev.multimedia.cx/?p=377\">http://x264dev.multimedia.cx/?p=377</a> in response to the question </p><p>\"Hey Steve - What did you make of the recent VP8 announcement?\" from Kris Bloe, a software developer from Leeds.</p><p>(Note that this conforms to what is becoming the template for getting an answer from Jobs - contains no links, asks straightforward questions, is a bit open-ended.)</p><p>Google announced that it was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2010/may/19/google-apple\">making VP8 open source</a> only on Wednesday - but it has led to fevered reactions since. Adobe is delighted, as it can use Flash within VP8. Others have said that the \"specification\" barely exists: the post that Jobs points to says, in part:</p><blockquote><p>\"The spec consists largely of C code copy-pasted from the VP8 source code \u2014 up to and including TODOs, \"optimizations\", and even C-specific hacks, such as workarounds for the undefined behavior of signed right shift on negative numbers. In many places it is simply outright opaque. <em>Copy-pasted C code is not a spec.</em>\"</p></blockquote><p>Yet Google has already starting putting YouTube videos into this spec, making it part of a larger web media project it calls WebM, which will be built into its Chrome browser - and which will be taken up by Mozilla's Firefox (which so far has been sticking to Ogg Theora, because it had no patents, but has now <a href=\"http://hacks.mozilla.org/2010/05/firefox-youtube-and-webm/\">admitted that that lagged in quality</a>). Internet Explorer 9 will let people install VP8 if they want - but its native support will be for H.264.</p><p>The key questions then become: will VP8 come in for scrutiny from patent attornies? The answer there is \"quite certainly\" - even if not Apple's or Microsoft's, there are sure to be people out there who will scour the code in the hope of finding an infringement and hence a payday.</p><p>The blogpost Jobs points to comes from the open source X.264 project, which aims to build a free encoding system for H.264 video. There are already open source decoders for it - notably <a href=\"http://www.ffmpeg.org/\">FFmpeg</a>. </p><p>So Jobs doesn't think that VP8 is as good as H.264 - and what Jobs thinks tends to reflect what Apple's engineers think, as they will be driving information to him (Apple is a very meetings-intensive company). That, plus the fact that the patent <del>trolls</del> investigators will be delightedly printing out the code for VP8 to see whether they can find something it infringes, means that video on the web breaks down to a few choices: Adobe's Flash (owned by Adobe); H.264 (patented like mad); VP8 (open source but at some risk of patent threats).</p><p>Meanwhile, if any of you have had email exchanges with Steve Jobs (his email is in the wild by now), do let us know. Remember: simple, but deep, questions do best.</p><img alt='' src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-apidev/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Google%27s+VP8+gets+thumbs+down+from+Apple%27s+Jobs+via+email+Article+1402289&ch=Technology&c2=&c4=Apple+%28Technology%29%2CSteve+Jobs+%28Technology%29%2CTechnology+blog%2CTechnology%2CBlogpost+%28Tone%29%2CCharles+Arthur%2CArticle+%28Content+type%29&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Charles+Arthur&c7=10-May-20&c8=1402289&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n            <a href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/technology/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/technology/oas.html/@Bottom\" alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\"></img>\n            </a>\n          </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: technology/blog/2010/may/20/apple-steve-jobs-vp8-patent|2010-05-24T22:56:07+01:00|db87e5a0465965d3139d3167048c5107fe62aba1 -->",
